## Running the HiFive Unmatched Board in GEM5
NOTE: The source code for the board in this directory is outdated.
The up to date source code for the board can be found in
*darchr/gem5/REU2022/riscv-validation* on github. To run this
board in gem5, do the following:  

1. Clone the gem5 repo and set it to the current working directory:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/darchr/gem5.git gem5_darchr
    cd gem5_darchr
    git checkout --track origin/REU2022/riscv-validation
    ```

2. Compile the gem5 RISCV binary.
    ```sh
    scons build/RISCV/gem5.opt -j<threads>
    ```

3. Run the board's hello world SE mode simulation script.
    ```sh
    ./build/RISCV/gem5.opt src/python/gem5/prebuilt/hifiveunmatched/hifive-run.py
    ```
    This should run a successful simulation and print "Hello world!".
    You can also run a custom RISCV binary by passing in the path
    to the binary via the command line. Here is an example:
    ```sh
    ./build/RISCV/gem5.opt src/python/gem5/prebuilt/hifiveunmatched/hifive-run.py --riscv_binary=bins/CCa.RISCV
    ```
    You can add one optional argument to the binary. Here is an example:
    ```sh
    ./build/RISCV/gem5.opt src/python/gem5/prebuilt/hifiveunmatched/hifive-run.py --riscv_binary=bins/CCa.RISCV --argv=10
    ```
